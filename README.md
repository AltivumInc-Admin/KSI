# FedRAMP 20x KSI Compliance Tracker

## Disclaimer

This is not an official FedRAMP dashboard.
It is an open-source utility developed by a veteran-led project to track key performance indicators related to FedRAMP alignment and system readiness. While it's built for internal use, it may be helpful to others navigating similar compliance goals or working toward authorization.

**Important Note:** Please be aware that FedRAMP KSIs can change at any time. While I (the repository owner) will make every effort to keep this tool up to date as I work toward compliance myself, I cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that all information is current. I hope to rely on community input to help maintain the accuracy and fidelity of this tool. If you notice any discrepancies or updates needed, please feel free to contribute or raise an issue.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Review KSI Categories** - Click headers to expand/collapse
2. **Check Off Requirements** - Click checkboxes as you complete items
3. **Update Status** - Use dropdowns to mark items as Not Started, In Progress, or Complete
4. **Add Evidence** - Document your implementation:
   - Write notes in the evidence text field
   - Upload supporting documents
   - Review evidence requirements
5. **Track Progress** - Monitor dashboard for overall completion
6. **Generate Reports** - Export progress for stakeholders or assessors

### Evidence Requirements

Each enhanced KSI displays:
- **Required Evidence Types** - What documents/reports you need
- **Collection Methods** - Whether evidence can be automated
- **Repository Locations** - Where to store evidence
- **Success Metrics** - Specific criteria to meet
- **NIST Controls** - Related security controls

### Audit Trail

The audit log automatically captures:
- Every status change
- Checklist modifications  
- Evidence updates
- Document management
- Timestamps for compliance

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
